<h1><u>HOW MJ MADE IT TO NBA</u></h1>
<h2>Jordan started playing in the year (1981–1984).In the Early NBA years (1984–1987) The Chicago Bulls selected Jordan with the third overall pick of the 1984 NBA draft after Hakeem Olajuwon (Houston Rockets) and Sam Bowie (Portland Trail Blazers). One of the primary reasons why Jordan was not drafted sooner was because the first two teams were in need of a center.MJ played in the years 1984–1993, 1995–1998, 2001–2003.</h2>
